<h2>Our values</h2>
<p>Our values converge in a culture that revolves around exploration, creativity, problem solving, and a willingness to push fast and iterate. We work hard as a team, have fun as a team, and we never take ourselves too seriously.</p>
<div id="faq-pay"></div>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>Transparency is the foundation for building trust in an open network. Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.</p>

<div id="faq-why"></div>
<h3>Meritocracy</h3>
<p>In a meritocracy, the best ideas win. Each person’s value comes from his or her individuality and uniqueness and the capacity to engage and interact with others to make the fruits of that uniqueness available. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather effort from the community.</p>

<h3>Open Information</h3>
<p>A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people are allowed to learn and use existing information toward creating new ideas. Spawned from this core idea, free and open source software promotes the development of the Internet as an open and trustworthy public resource.</p>

<div id="faq-who"></div>
<h3>Open collaboration</h3>
<p>When we are free to collaborate we can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own and learn from each other in the process.</p>

<div id="faq-adv"></div>
<h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
<p>Learn by doing. Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid failures, but that leads to better solutions found faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and look for answers in new places.</p>

<div id="faq-whose"></div>
<h3>Pluralism & Diversity</h3>
<p>No one has done this before. This means that there is no *right* or *wrong* way of doing things and by definition it's a trial and error process. From each failed experiment we learn and improve for the next experiment.</p>

<div id="faq-whose"></div>
<h3>Practical idealism</h3>
<p>Technologies and solutions that can be generalized as world positive are worthy to be pursued and explored. When others ask 'why bother?' we ask 'why not?'</p>
